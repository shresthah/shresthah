*Unraveling the Tapestry of Cancer: Exploring Cells, Genes, and Hope.*

<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a molecular and cell biologist. I have a broad background in cancer biology with specific training in breast and pancreatic cancer.<br><br>I received my Ph.D. in Pharmacy (Molecular Pathology) from Chonnam National University, South Korea in 2017. There I gained technical and professional expertise in molecular and cell biology. During my Ph.D. studies, I studied factors affecting Adherens Junction complexes and assessed the role of the protein δ-catenin in cancer initiation and progression.<br><br>

I joined <a href="http://www.wagnerlab.net">Dr. Kay-Uwe Wagner’s lab </a> at School of Medicine Wayne State University in early 2018 as a Postdoctoral Fellow. During my time there <i>[2018-2024]</i>, I focused my efforts on elucidating the mechanisms regulating the normal development of the mammary gland and pancreas and identifying genetic pathways that control breast and pancreatic cancer development using genetically engineered mouse models. <br><br>

Following my relocation to Connecticut for a family reunion in mid-2024, I took the opportunity to spend meaningful time with my 4-year-old son. Having dedicated this period to my family, I have also been focusing on expanding my bioinformatics skills through self-directed learning. <i><u>I am now seeking new professional opportunities and prepared to advance to the next chapter of my scientific career.</u></i> My primary research interests include cellular signaling in the early development of glandular tissues, inflammatory conditions, and cancer progression, and cancer drug development.
