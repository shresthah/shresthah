<div style="text-align: justify"> After a long day in the lab, I love to escape to my favorite spot in Detroit: Belle Isle. It’s just a short ten-minute drive away and offers a beautiful island park in the Detroit River, close to downtown. It’s my go-to spot for relaxation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Isle_Park">[Click here to learn more about this stunning park]</a>. Watching the sunset there is truly refreshing, as the sky turns into a vibrant canvas. Spending time with family makes it even better. As soon as I arrive, I can feel the stress of the day melting away. The cool breeze and the soothing sounds of the water are the perfect remedy after a busy day of research. Here are some photos I took on a cold winter day.</div>
